# Build Android app:

flutter build appbundle
This creates bread_basket/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab which can be uploaded to Google Play Console.

# Build iOS app:

open project in XCode, use Product > Archive. Then wait for the build to finish and follow the steps to validate and distribute the version through the new window that pops up. This will make the app available in App Store Connect.
